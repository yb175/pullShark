### 🤔 The Problem: "But it passed the Linter!"

We've all been there.
1. You write code.
2. The linter says "No syntax errors! ✅"
3. The tests pass.
4. You merge to production.
5. **The server crashes because of an infinite loop in an edge case nobody thought of.** 💥

Standard tools check your **syntax** (commas, brackets, styles). They don't check your **logic**.

### 💡 The Solution: Meet PullShark

**PullShark AI** is an automated Senior Engineer that lives in your Pull Requests. It doesn't care about your indentation; it cares about your **code's behavior**.

It simulates execution paths to find "Logic Bombs"—infinite loops, resource exhaustion, and unhandled edge cases—that human reviewers and standard linters often miss.

> **The "One-Line Change" Disaster:**
> In our demo, a developer changed a simple log message. A linter would call this "trivial."
> **PullShark saw the truth:** That change was inside a conditional block where the `else` statement contained a `while(true)` loop that would freeze the server if the input wasn't perfect.
> **Result:** Crisis averted. 🛑

### 🚀 Key Features

**🧠 Behavioral Analysis (Not Just Regex)**
PullShark understands control flow. It knows that `while(true)` is fine in a background worker but **fatal** in a request handler.

**🛡️ Security First**
It flags potential **Denial of Service (DoS)** vectors where user input could trick your app into hanging or consuming 100% CPU.

**🧪 Automatic Test Architect**
Don't just fix the bug—prove it's fixed. PullShark generates **Checklists & Test Plans** for QA, specifically targeting the edge cases you missed (e.g., *"What happens if this API returns `null` instead of `1`?"*).

**💬 No Noise, Just Signal**
We won't spam you about trailing spaces. We only speak up when there's a real risk. If PullShark comments, **you should listen.**

---

### ⚡ How It Works

1.  **Install the App:** Add PullShark to your GitHub repo (SaaS or Self-Hosted).
2.  **Open a PR:** Work as usual.
3.  **The Shark Swims:** PullShark silently analyzes the logic changes in the background.
4.  **The Bite:** If a high-risk logic error is found, PullShark posts a detailed alert with a reproduction path.
